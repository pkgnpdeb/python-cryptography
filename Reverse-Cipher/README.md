# Algorithm of Reverse Cipher

```
#The algorithm of reverse cipher holds the following features -

* Reverse Cipher uses a pattern of reversing the string of plain text to convert as cipher text.
* The process of encryption and decryption is same.
* To decrypt cipher text, the user simply needs to reverse the cipher text to get the plain text.

# Explanation:

* Plain text is stored in the variable message and the translated variable is used to store the cipher text created.
* The length of plain text is calculated using for loop and with help of index number. 
* The characters are stored in cipher text variable translated which is printed in the last line.
