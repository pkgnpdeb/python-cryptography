## How to Decrypt with the Transposition Cipher on Paper

* Pretend you’ve sent the ciphertext “Cenoonommstmme oo snnio. s s c” to a friend (and they already know that the secret key is 8). 
* The first step for them to decrypt the ciphertext is to calculate the number of boxes they need to draw. 
* To determine this number, they must divide the length of the ciphertext message by the key and round up to the nearest whole number 
* If the result isn’t already a whole number. The length of the ciphertext is 30 characters (the same as the plaintext) and the key is 8, so 30 divided by 8 is       3.75.
* Decrypting the message by reversing the grid:
