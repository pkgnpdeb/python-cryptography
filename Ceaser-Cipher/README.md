# Ceaser Cipher, Ceaser Cipher Brute-Force attack and Transportation Cipher

## Algorithm of Ceaser Cipher 

```
# The algorithm of Caesar cipher holds the following features âˆ’
* Caesar Cipher Technique is the simple and easy method of encryption technique.
* It is simple type of substitution cipher.
* Each letter of plain text is replaced by a letter with some fixed number of positions down with alphabet.

# Explanation

* The plain text character is traversed one at a time.
* For each character in the given plain text, transform the given character as per the rule depending on the procedure of encryption and decryption of text.
* After the steps is followed, a new string is generated which is referred as cipher text.
