# Ceaser Cipher, Ceaser Cipher Brute-Force attack and Transportation Cipher

## Algorithm of Ceaser Cipher 

```
# The algorithm of Caesar cipher holds the following features âˆ’
* Caesar Cipher Technique is the simple and easy method of encryption technique.
* It is simple type of substitution cipher.
* Each letter of plain text is replaced by a letter with some fixed number of positions down with alphabet.

# Explanation

* The plain text character is traversed one at a time.
* For each character in the given plain text, transform the given character as per the rule depending on the procedure of encryption and decryption of text.
* After the steps is followed, a new string is generated which is referred as cipher text.

## Algorithm of Transposition Cipher 
```
Transposition Cipher is a cryptographic algorithm where the order of alphabets in the plaintext is rearranged to form a cipher text. In this process, the actual plain text alphabets are not included.

Example
A simple example for a transposition cipher is columnar transposition cipher where each character in the plain text is written horizontally with specified alphabet width. The cipher is written vertically, which creates an entirely different cipher text.

Consider the plain text hello world, and let us apply the simple columnar transposition technique as shown below

Columnar Transposition
The plain text characters are placed horizontally and the cipher text is created with vertical format as : holewdlo lr. Now, the receiver has to use the same table to decrypt the cipher text to plain text.
